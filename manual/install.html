<h1>Installing mccune, Mace4, and Friends</h1>

<h2>Unix-like Systems</h2>

Here is a quick example for Unix-like systems, including Linux and Macintosh OS X.
Visit the <a href=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mccune/>mccune Web page</a>
and download the current version of LADR.  The filename should be something
like <tt>LADR-June-2006A.tar.gz</tt>; make sure that file is in your current
directory.  Run the following commands.

<pre class="my_job">
% zcat LADR-June-2006A.tar.gz | tar xvf -
% cd LADR-June-2006A
% make all
</pre>

<p>
mccune, Mace4, Prooftrans, and several other programs should now
be in the directory <tt>LADR-June-2006A/bin</tt>.   You can either include
that directory in your search path or copy those programs to
some directory that is already in your search path.

<h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>
