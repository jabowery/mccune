In group theory, if @ is the commutator operation,
the following four properties are known to be equivalent.

<pre>
    <I>(x @ y) @ z = u @ (v @ w)</I>          (A) "associativity" of commutator
    <I>(x @ y) * z = z * (x @ y)</I>          (N) nilpotency of class 2
    <I>(x * y) @ z = (x @ z) * (y @ z)</I>    (D) distributivity of commutator
    <I>x*y*z*y*x = y*x*z*x*y</I>              (E) CS essence of (N)
</pre>

In cancellative semigroups, we cannot define the commutator
operation, because we don't necessarily have in inverse operation.
<P>
Consider, however, the following property of the commutator operation.

<pre>
    y * x * (x @ y) = x * y.    % CS admits commutator
</pre>

Then the four properties hold for cancellative semigroups.
<P>
Here are 24 proofs.  We prove all pairwise implications between the
four properties for both group theory and cancellative semigroups.
(Of course we only need 8 of these proofs.)

The file <TT>AD-gt.out</TT> means (A) -> (D) for group theory.
