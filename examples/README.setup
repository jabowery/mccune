How to make a Web page for a set of jobs.


Make a "go" script that runs the jobs.  Start with go.template.

./go /home/mccune/bin out

set d=/home/mccune/public_html/examples

$d/xmler /home/mccune/bin           (uses *.out)

cp $d/{proof3,interp3}.{dtd,xsl} .

$d/xml-to-html   (optional)

$d/go-to-html.py go > index.html

Explain the jobs in the html.

$d/jobs-into-html.py go index.html   This inserts the links for the jobs.
